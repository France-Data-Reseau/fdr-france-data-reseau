single step deduplication
(rather than 1. list dups couples 2. process them according to any rules (CTE on their values AND possibly enriched by human experts choices) 3. loop)

TODO obviously faster if indexed on id_fields

example :
{{ dedupe('id_deduped', id_fields=['"geometry"']) }}

parameters :
- source_name : a valid SQL alias or relation reference
- id_fields : to dedupe on
- order_by : to resolve dedupe in addition to id fields
- where : filter ex. to remove those without id fields or get a subset

The best method varies depending on the database server.

Postgresql :

using "distinct on"
(or for more control on order ex. first like "limit 1" on bigquery, "partition by" window function)

other ones :
ctid if no id fields, but for performance they should have a primary key so ctid not possible (on solutions, by order of performance : where, window function, distinct on ??) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53722174/most-efficient-way-to-remove-duplicates-postgres

BigQuery : using aggregation.

inspired by https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/issues/335

single pass dedup, rules (& choices) are limited to what can be provided in array_agg

It is more performant (can handle more rows, not necessarily faster) than using row_count().
Adding the LIMIT 1 allows BQ to vastly reduce the dataset it needs to calculate the query.

Pass in a source, so that this can be used also as a separate CTE.

Tried to make it work on postgresql, but failed :
(returns a single array column or "subscripting" error, see :
